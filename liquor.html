            <p>Liquor is an alcoholic drink produced by distillation of grains, fruits, vegetables, or sugar, that have already gone through alcoholic fermentation. Other terms for liquor include: spirit, distilled beverage, spirituous liquor or hard liquor. The distillation process concentrates the liquid to increase its alcohol by volume. As liquors contain significantly more alcohol than other alcoholic drinks, they are considered 'harder'; in North America, the term hard liquor is sometimes used to distinguish distilled alcoholic drinks from non-distilled ones, whereas the term spirits is more common in the UK. Some examples of liquors include vodka, rum, gin, and tequila. Liquors are often aged in barrels, such as for the production of brandy and whiskey, or are infused with flavorings to form a flavored liquor such as absinthe.</p>
    
            <h3>5 Health Benefits Of Drinking Alcohol</h3>

            <img src="images/alcohol-moderation-has-number-health-benefits.webp"  alt="put" style="width:  550px; margin: 1px auto;
            display: block; height: 250px;">

            <p>Getting wasted every weekend might not be the best thing for your physical or mental well-being, but moderate alcohol consumption may have some substantial health benefits. It should be noted that alcohol consumption and its benefits vary based on an individual's body makeup and type.</p>
            <p>According to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, "moderate alcohol consumption is defined as having up to one drink per day for women and up to two drinks per day for men. This definition is referring to the amount consumed on any single day and is not intended as an average over several days."</p>
            <p>Now, we've all heard the reasons why alcohol is bad for you, but what about the benefits? Here is our list of seven ways that drinking alcohol in moderation (when you're of the legal drinking age of course) might benefit your health.</p>

            <h2>1. It Can Lower Your Risk Of Cardiovascular Disease</h2>

            <p>The School of Public Health at Harvard University found that "moderate amounts of alcohol raises levels of high-density lipoprotein, HDL, or 'good' cholesterol and higher HDL levels are associated with greater protection against heart disease. Moderate alcohol consumption has also been linked with beneficial changes ranging from better sensitivity to insulin to improvements in factors that influence blood clotting....Such changes would tend to prevent the formation of small blood clots that can block arteries in the heart, neck, and brain, the ultimate cause of many heart attacks and the most common kind of stroke." This finding is applicable to both men and women who have not been previously diagnosed with any type of cardiovascular disease.</p>

            <h2>2. It Can Lengthen Your Life</h2>

            <p>Drinking occasionally could add a few years to your life. A study by the Catholic University of Campobasso reported that drinking less than four or two drinks per day for men and women respectively could reduce the risk of death by 18 percent, as reported by Reuters. "Little amounts, preferably during meals, this appears to be the right way (to drink alcohol)," said Dr. Giovanni de Gaetano of Catholic University, another author on the study. "This is another feature of the Mediterranean diet, where alcohol, wine above all, is the ideal partner of a dinner or lunch, but that's all: the rest of the day must be absolutely alcohol-free."</p>

            <h2>3. It Can Improve Your Libido</h2>

            <p>Contrary to prior beliefs, newer research has found that moderate drinking might actually protect against erectile dysfunction in the same way that drinking red wine might benefit heart disease. In a 2009 study published in the, Journal of Sexual Medicine, researchers found that the chances of erectile dysfunction were reduced by 25 to 30 percent among alcohol drinkers. The lead researcher, Kew-Kim Chew, an epidemiologist at the University of West Australia, conducted the study with 1,770 Australian men. In his study, Chew cautiously noted that he and his team in no way are advising men to hit the bottle, and that further research is needed to accurately connect impotence and alcohol consumption.

            </p>

            <h2>4. It Helps Prevent Against the Common Cold</h2>

            <p>The Department of Psychology at Carnegie Mellon University found that while susceptibility to the common cold was increased by smoking, moderate alcohol consumption led to a decrease in common cold cases for nonsmokers. This study was conducted in 1993 with 391 adults. In 2002, according to the New York Times, Spanish researchers found that by drinking eight to 14 glasses of wine per week, particularly red wine, one could see a 60-percent reduction in the risk of developing a cold. The scientists suspected that this had something to do with the antioxidant properties of wine.</p>

            <h2>5. It Can Decrease Chances Of Developing Dementia</h2>

            <p>In a study that included more than 365,000 participants since 1977, as reported in the journal Neuropsychiatric Disease and Treatment, moderate drinkers were 23 percent less likely to develop cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia. "Small amounts of alcohol might, in effect, make brain cells more fit. Alcohol in moderate amounts stresses cells and thus toughens them up to cope with major stresses down the road that could cause dementia," said Edward J. Neafsey, Ph.D., co-author of the study, as reported by Science Daily. "We don't recommend that nondrinkers start drinking," Neafsey said. "But moderate drinking — if it is truly moderate — can be beneficial."</p>

                    <p>Angostura is a concentrated bitters made with herbs and spices. It was developed in 1824, when a German doctor Johann Gottlieb Benjamin Siegert, who was a surgeon general for Simón Bolívar, used a secret blend of botanicals, including angelica, cinchona, ginger, cinnamon, cardamom, and orange peel, to create an antifebrile tonic.

                    The drink was an instant success and was later mainly used as a flavor enhancement because of the fairly high alcohol content of 44.7%. Due to political turmoil, Siegert relocated his company from Venezuelan city of Angostura (Ciudad Bolivar) to Trinidad and Tobago, where it still operates. </p>

                    <p>Blue Curaçao is a type of Curaçao liqueur—naturally colorless liqueur that is flavored with Laraha oranges. This variety is artificially colored to attain its distinctive, vibrant blue color. This clear drink has a typical orange flavor, though the final taste profile may vary depending on the producer.

                    There are several manufactures on the market, but they are not necessarily located on Curaçao, and some even do not use Laraha oranges. Blue Curaçao is mostly used as a flavoring and coloring agent in cocktails.</p>

It is produced from natural pomegranate juice, premium vodka, and a small amount of imported tequila. Pama is praised for its berry aroma and a unique combination of sweet and tart flavors.

                    Although it can be enjoyed on its own, preferably on the rocks with a lemon twist, it also pairs exceptionally well with bubbly drinks such as ginger ale, tonic water, sparkling wines, and Champagne.</p>

                    <p>Curaçao is a popular liqueur flavored with Laraha (Curaçao orange), which is cultivated on the namesake island in the southern Caribbean Sea. The story of its invention started in the 16th century when the Spanish colonizers brought Valencian oranges to Curaçao.

                    The fruit did not adapt well to the local climate, and it was almost inedible. It took decades for the locals to realize that the dried peel is rich with essential oils and incredibly aromatic. The peel was then used in the production of liqueurs, and though it is not certain, many believe that the commercial production was started in 1896 by the Senior family. </p>

                    They typically do not have high alcohol content. Coconut-flavored rums are internationally produced, but their spiritual home remains on the Caribbean islands. Their light and aromatic character is best showcased in tropical cocktails.</p>

                    <p>RumChata is a rum-based cream liqueur that is produced in Wisconsin. The base is made with light Caribbean rum that is distilled five times. It is then mixed with locally-sourced fresh dairy cream, sugar, and a spice blend that includes vanilla and cinnamon.

                    The drink was modeled on horchata—a creamy drink popular in Spain and Latin America that usually combines rice, milk, sugar, and spices. The name is also a reference to the drink—it is a portmanteau of rum and horchata. RumChata is a light, creamy liqueur that is not overly sweet or cloying. </p>

The rum is then combined with sugar and coconut extract to achieve its light character and subtle coconut flavors and aromas.

                    It is bottled at 21% ABV. Malibu was invented to simplify the preparation of piña coladas. When it became popular, the entire production was moved to Barbados, and the overall quality of the liqueur was improved. Malibu is nowadays the most popular coconut-flavored rum in the world. </p>

                    <p>In its original form, this Southern classic used whiskey as its base, along with a secret combination of spices. Sometime in the 20th century, the original recipe was changed, and whiskey was merely used as a flavoring, while the drink was based on a neutral grain spirit.

                    First created by Martin W. Heron in New Orleans, Southern Comfort is appreciated for its smooth flavor, with hints of fruits and spices. It can be enjoyed neat or on the rocks, but it also works well as a cocktail ingredient. In 2016, the brand was bought by Sazerac, a company that is trying to bring Southern Comfort back to its original form.</p>

        <p>This award-winning Mexican coffee liqueur was first introduced in 1936. It was created in Veracruz and was named Kahlúa, which in ancient Veracruz Nahuatl language means the house of the Acolhua people. Rum-based Kahlúa is a full-bodied liqueur with enticing flavor and aromas of roasted coffee beans and hints of vanilla and caramel.

        It is a mainstay in bars across the world, and though it works great on its own, preferably served on the rocks, it is mostly used in cocktails, out of which the most popular are White Russian, Espresso Martini, and a layered B52 shot. Because of its sweetness, it is also a great complement to desserts.</p>
